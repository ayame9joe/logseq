title:: Logseq whiteboard with tldraw/shape reordering

- makes sense thanks for the explanation, so I guess currently the z-order was a number assigned on import, so say I import a stack of 50 pics, the z-order is set between 1-50 (so more  `move backwards`  are needed ? if I import 3 images the z is between 1 - 3 ?
