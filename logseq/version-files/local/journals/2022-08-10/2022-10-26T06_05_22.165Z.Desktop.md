- Google Keybinding `KeyHandler`seems stopropagation for sequencial keybindings
	- e.g., `t t` will stop `t` even if the whole is not handled
	- Seems this is related in the source code
		- If `false`, the propagation is stopped only if stopPropagation is called on either of the corresponding `SHORT_CUT_TRIGGERED` or `SHORTCUT_PREFIX` events.
		- The default value is `true`.

		- Logseq uses https://github.com/google/closure-library/blob/master/closure/goog/ui/keyboardshortcuthandler.js#L474 to register shortcuts
		- Seems setting `(.setAlwaysStopPropagation handler false)` not working
		- Seems that if an event is `preventDefault`, it will be ignored by MouseTrap?
			- It looks like by default MouseTrap listens to `keypress`. a Keypress event is composed by keydown & keyup. If keydown event is `defaultPrevented`, the keypress event will not be called
