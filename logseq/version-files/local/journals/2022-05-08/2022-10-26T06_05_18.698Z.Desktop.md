- Thoughts on staring [[Logseq whiteboard with tldraw]]
	- some facts shown in ((6bcfee03-8caa-4aad-ad61-a8575c4a2665))
		- `@tldraw/tldraw` is mostly feature complete and the author is maintaining it with minor fixes and features
		- `tldraw/next` is still actively developing, but the new code is done in a private code base
		- `tldraw/next` makes some progress on providing custom shape easier etc
		- the Discord server has the frontier knowledge on the development and community
	- some conclusions
		- it is not a good idea to make a customization over the version 1, but start on the next version
		- the next version provides a clearer picture on the future design
	- my next step
		- build a custom build for Logseq
