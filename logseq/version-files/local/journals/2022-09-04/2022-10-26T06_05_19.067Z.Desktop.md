- Struggling Electron quit unexpectedly for Logseq development
	- There is an issue on Mac, starting probably early this week that Logseq running in electron dev mode immediate crashes after running with  `yarn dev-electron-app` . In the crash report, it prompts an error   `EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGKILL (Code Signature Invalid))`   in the crash report. Any ideas on how to fix this?
	- The error is gone after I remove the `/static` dir and rebuild. But the error is back after restarting

	- Some user mentioned that manually signing may help?

		- But I did not even know where is the Electron app

	- Logseq did change [codesigning in GitHub action](https://github.com/logseq/logseq/pull/6522/files), however seems not related
	- Restarting with `electron-forge start --inspect-electron --enable-logging`
	- `bootstrap_look_up com.deeplink.logseq.MachPortRendezvousServer.45931: Permission denied (1100)`
		- this throws at every first full-rebuild Logseq run. What is it?
	- The following may fix the [[codesign]] issue
		- ```

- [Building data-centric apps with a reactive relational database](https://riffle.systems/essays/prelude/#findings) #[[reading notes]]
	- this is really a good essay to read
	- [[local-first application]] vs server-side rendering (where I did most of the work on SaaS platforms)
	- "normalized base state" - Just like DataScript in Logseq
	- Low latency is a critical property for reactive systems
		- When running locally, it is more easily to achieve 16ms frame in an "sync style"
			- When queries happen locally, they are fast enough to run in the core reactive loop. In the span of a single frame (16ms on a 60Hz display, or even 8ms on modern 120Hz display), we have enough time to ① write a new track to the database, ② re-run the queries that change because of that new track, and ③ propagate those updates to the UI. From the point of view of the developer and user, there was no intermediate invalid state.
			- It should be fast enough to sync a write/read in one frame and therefore no invalid state
		- Legacy DB systems are not expecting UI storing states in DB. However modern computer is fast enough to be used this way
