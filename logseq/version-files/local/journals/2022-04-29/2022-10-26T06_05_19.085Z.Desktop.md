		- [[Feature]: Plugin Shapes](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/360) it seems **define custom shapes as plugins** is in his radar
		- https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/408 as well, recommended to use `@tldraw/core` to build a customized solution
		- A similar planned feature, https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/513, that mentioned drag & drop custom **component**.
			- I think the component here is a React component?
	- Logseq block renderer? Maybe `logseq-tldraw` library just for Logseq?
	- Plotting ideas on the [[Excalidraw]] plugin in Obsidian? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0exK-xFP3k
		- Because of the custom texts, I think it the result TLDR file may be only useful for Logseq in the long term ...
	- **Images & other assets are disabled** since this app is also used in a multiplayer context
- Some other trivial findings on [[tldraw]]
	- `Tldraw` vs `TldrawApp`
		- `TldrawApp` seems to be the state ref to `Tldraw`
		- **vscode plugin** shows how to handle files in & out
	- Seems pasting image is **not** supported
		- https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/550
	- A single session (`.tldr` file) can have multiple pages
	- A fork to turn tl;draw into a slide https://github.com/nimeshnayaju/tlslides
	- The author also ==started a `next` repo for tldraw==
		- https://github.com/tldraw/next
		- which includes a demo for **including youtube videos** https://tldrawnext.vercel.app/
