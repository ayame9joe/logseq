- [[React RFC]] for [[React first class promise support of use hook and suspense]]
  id:: 634cb50b-a623-475f-9524-990e7c566c57
	- ```js
	  // `use` inside of a React component or Hook...
	  const data = use(promise);
	  
	  // ...roughly equates to `await` in an async function
	  const data = await promise;
	  ```
	- `use` can be used conditionally
	- `use` can be used for context as well
	- ```
	  const resolvedValue = use(promise);
	  const contextualValue = use(Context);
	  - // Potential future Usable types
	  // (Purely hypothetical, not part of this proposal)
	  const currentState = use(store);
	  const latestValue = use(observable);
	  // ...and so on
	  ```
	- `cache` is a missing piece in the proposal
