	- `ShadowRealm`
	- `Compartment` - this seems to be more interesting, but I cannot see when it will be moved to stable stage
		- can be used to create a new global context
		- provides api to control module resolution
		- has it own `moduleMap`
		- default objects are actually have the same prototype
	- `import.meta`
		- Is it possible to use `import.meta` to find out the importers?
		- There is no real benefit to locking down the object, as it is local to the module, and can only be shared explicitly by passing it around. It does not represent "global state" or anything of the sort.
