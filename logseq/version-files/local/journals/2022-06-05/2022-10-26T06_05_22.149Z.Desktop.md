- What I have learnt from [[Logseq whiteboard with tldraw/context menu drifting]]?
	- Shapes and other drawn elements on the screen are wrapped with positioned containers to place different elements in the same context
	- Scale (zoom) is applied at the very top of the canvas via `--tl-scale` variable. To make transformations of shapes based on the screen coordinates, make sure they are converted back to the canvas coordinates
