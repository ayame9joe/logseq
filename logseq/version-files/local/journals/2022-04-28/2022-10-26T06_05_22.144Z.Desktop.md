- Took some time to build a template with [[Rum]] [[shadow-cljs]], with [[Tailwind CSS]] (dev only)
	- [Hot Reload in ClojureScript](https://code.thheller.com/blog/shadow-cljs/2019/08/25/hot-reload-in-clojurescript.html)
- [[shadow-cljs]] has a section on explaining using npm packages
	- https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_using_npm_packages
- [[Logseq whiteboard with tldraw]]
	- I am trying to use [[tldraw]] inside of the playground, but it contains dynamic import in `@tldraw/tldraw`
	  collapsed:: true
		- DONE `Dynamic import expressions cannot be transpiled`
		  collapsed:: true
			- It seems it is out of the author's interest https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs/issues/486
			- Two options
				- Custom build of tldraw to eliminate dynamic import
				- Have a local transform
			- Seems to be a bug introduced recently
